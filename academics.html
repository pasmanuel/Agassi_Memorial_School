				<h3> Preschool Programme</h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					In our Preschool program at Agassi Memorial School, we lay the foundation for a lifetime of learning by fostering curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking skills. Our curriculum is carefully crafted to provide a balance of structured learning experiences and child-directed exploration, empowering students to become active participants in their own education.
					<br>
					<br>
					Through thematic units based on children's interests and experiences, we integrate literacy, numeracy, science, and social studies concepts into engaging and meaningful activities. From storytelling and dramatic play to hands-on experiments and art projects, we create a dynamic learning environment where every child can shine.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our experienced educators understand that each child learns differently, which is why we differentiate instruction to meet the unique needs and interests of every student. Small group activities, one-on-one interactions, and cooperative learning opportunities allow children to develop at their own pace while building confidence and self-esteem.
					<br>
					<br>
					At Agassi Memorial School, we believe in the power of play as a fundamental tool for learning. Our indoor and outdoor play spaces provide opportunities for gross motor development, socialization, and imaginative play, fostering the physical, social, and emotional well-being of our students.

				<h3> Primary Programme</h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
					As students transition into Lower Primary at Agassi Memorial School, our focus shifts to building upon the foundational skills developed in Preschool while introducing more structured academic content. Our comprehensive curriculum encompasses core subjects such as English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies, as well as opportunities for enrichment and exploration.
					<br>
					<br>
					In our Lower Primary classrooms, students engage in hands-on learning experiences that promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration. Through inquiry-based projects, experiments, and real-world applications, we inspire curiosity and ignite a passion for learning that extends beyond the classroom.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our dedicated educators create a supportive learning environment where every child feels valued, respected, and empowered to reach their full potential. We provide ongoing assessment and feedback to monitor student progress and tailor instruction to meet individual learning needs, ensuring that every student receives the support and challenge they need to succeed.
					<br>
					<br>
					In addition to our rigorous academic curriculum, we offer a variety of extracurricular activities to enrich the educational experience of our Lower Primary students. Whether it's exploring the wonders of nature, delving into the world of coding and robotics, or expressing themselves through art and music, we provide opportunities for students to pursue their passions and interests outside of the classroom
					<br>
					<br>
					At Agassi Memorial School, we are committed to providing a holistic education that nurtures the whole child – intellectually, socially, emotionally, and physically. Through our Creche, Preschool, and Lower Primary programs, we lay the groundwork for a lifetime of learning, curiosity, and personal growth.
